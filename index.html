										<h4>Math</h4>

										<p>
											I am immersed in competitive math regarding various competitions such as the
											AMC 8, Caribou, Mathematica, Gauss, Canada Jay and BCC. Currently, I am
											working towards learning more advanced high school competitive math to excel
											in competitions like the AMC 10. Inspired by my sister Grace, my goal is to
											triumph at an international level.

										<p>
											My experience in programming spans both competitive programming and
											project development. While I study competitive programming
											techniques and solve problems on DMOJ (check out my resources hub!) to
											prepare for competitions such as the CCC, I work on projects such as this
											one (check out my portfolio for other projects) to expand my skills in
											multiple langauges and interfaces.

											concepts with the goal of participating more in competitions in the future.

									<h4>Ignition Hacks 2025</h4>

									<em>
										<span>Best Woman's Hack</span>
										<span>August 16-17</span>
									</em>

									<p>
										In collaboration with Olivia Pu (my twin sister), I won Best Woman's Hack at
										Ignition Hacks v. 6! My favourite aspect of this experience was being able to
										learn, interact with Ignition hacks sponsors, and meet other people with a
										similar passion for coding! You can find our project, WhiskIt, in my Portfolio
										page; and you can discover more about my experience in my Blog!

									<h4>Summer Of Making</h4>

									<em>
										<span>Hacker</span>
										<span>June 2025-CURRENT</span>
									</em>

									<p>
										This Hack Club event is still ongoing! Currently, I have completed 2 projects
										(explore them in my projects page!) and plan to finish at least 2 more by the
										end of this summer. I continue to familiarize myself with various
										programming concepts and tools by particpating in Hack Club workshops and
										completing my own personal projects to recieve shells as rewards (they can be
										traded in the shop) !
									</p>

								<div class='timeline-content'>

									<h4>Parkrun</h4>

									<em>
										<span>Personal Best</span>
										<span>June 2025</span>
									</em>

									<p>
										During my first parkrun, I beat my previous PB in the 5K with a time of 23
										minutes and 49 seconds! However, the most valuable part of this run was being
										able to experience the joy of running with my family and friends.
									</p>

									<h4>Track and Field Season</h4>

									<em>
										<span>Masters Degree</span>
										<span>June 2025</span>
									</em>

									<p>
										After receiving 5 ribbons at my school's Track and Field event, I represented
										Crosby in the 1500m and Standing Long Jump in the Area Track and Field meet;
										placing 1st and 3rd, respectively. As the first and second athletes of every
										event and grade move on to represent their Area at Regionals, I was eligible to
										participate in the 1500m race at Bill Crothers SS on June 17. In the end, I
										placed 6th with a time of 5 minutes and 45 seconds!
									</p>

								<div class='timeline-content'>

									<h4>Poetry Slam</h4>

									<em>
										<span>Reached Finals!</span>
										<span>September-June 2025</span>
									</em>

									<p>
										I was a contributor to Crosby's Poetry Slam club & team as a writer and
										volunteer who indulged in the art of poetry and helped organizers prepare
										for the Regionals competiton. In the Area competition, Regional competition, and
										Finals, we placed first, second, and third, respectively!
									</p>

								<div class='timeline-content'>

									<h4>CanAI contest</h4>

									<em>
										<span>Pending Results</span>
										<span>May 2024</span>
									</em>

									<p>
										With Olivia, I programmed REVUZE, an (as quoted
										from our github repository README) "analytical tool designed to help businesses
										enhance their customer service by providing valuable input into their
										areas of improvement through the analysis of Google reviews. The application
										consists of a web scraper which accesses the reviews, a sentiment analyzer, and
										a keyword extractor." Instead of the expected Scratch project, we created a
										Python script and also a <a
											href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIvkRpm0O4'>video</a> that pitches
										our application. To find out more about our project, visit my projects page or
										this <a

											repo</a>.

									<h4>Let's Talk Science Challenge</h4>

									<em>
										<span>Bronze</span>
										<span>Feburary - May 2025</span>
									</em>

									<p>
										Throughout the period of 4 months, I participated in the Let's Talk Science
										Challenge with my twin sister Olivia as Hyposulfite. We managed to study the
										handbook extensively while prioritizing math competition preparation, and placed
										Bronze in a nationwide event!
									</p>

								<div class='timeline-content'>

									<h4>Gauss Competition</h4>

									<em>
										<span>Outstanding Performance</span>
										<span>June 2025</span>
									</em>

									<p>
										In the Gauss Competition, which is hosted by the University of Waterloo, I
										received
										the Outstanding Performance certificate for the highest score in my school
										(perfect)! The competition is challenging and though-provoking, so I was
										delighted
										with my performance.

									<h4>Mathematica</h4>

									<em>
										<span>Perfect</span>
										<span>April 2025</span>
									</em>

									<p>
										I scored perfect on Mathematica, a math contest with 40 questions that are
										finished
										in 1 hour and 15 minutes! Afterwards, I received a medal celebrating my merit
										and a
										certificate of distinction.
									</p>

								<div class='timeline-content'>

									<h4>Caribou</h4>

									<em>
										<span>Perfect</span>
										<span>October-April 2025</span>
									</em>

									<p>
										Over the course of 5 months (excluding December and March as a result of the
										winter and march break), I endured through Caribou competitions and endulged
										myself
										into the website's engaging games and history content to secure a 95% average
										across
										the five contests (3 perfect). In the Caribou Cup, I placed
										<strong>28th</strong>
										out of
										<strong>19377</strong> students in the <strong>WORLD</strong>,
										<strong></strong>25th</strong> out of <strong>15264</strong> participants in
										<strong>Canada</strong>, <strong>2nd</strong> out of <strong>317</strong>
										students in <strong>York Region District School Board</strong>, and finally
										<strong>1st</strong> out of <strong>142</strong> participants in <strong>Crosby
											Heights Public School</strong>!

									It is with pleasure that I write this letter of reference for Sophia Pu. She strives
									to be excellent in all aspects of
									her life including academics and volunteering in her community. She has volunteered
									approximately 35 hours from October
									2nd to June 18th. Sophia is a member of the City of Richmond Hill's Youth Action
									Committee, a Committee of Council. This
									committee is a voice for youth ages 13-18 to advise Town Council and staff from the
									Community Services of issues and
									concerns that pertain to youth in their community. Being a member of this committee
									requires her to have strong
									leadership and time management skills. Providing advice and volunteering at various
									community functions is a role that
									she takes very seriously. There is no question that Sophia would make a terrific
									role model for the youth in our
									community. She is friendly and gracious and makes every experience positive. If you
									have any questions or would like to
									further discuss her role in the Youth Action Committee, please contact myself at
									905-882-4295 Ext. 3154 or by e-mail at

												<h4>Mental Math Tricks Courses</h4>

												<!--project popup description-->
												<p>
													Pursued my passion for Math in an interactive and educational
													application that taught users mental math tricks with varying
													difficulty. As enthusiasm for Math has been declining over the years
													due to students lacking a passion for the subject, I added more fun
													and appealing courses rather than tedious and boring lessons. I
													created MMT using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and it now has 5 courses
													each with a detailed lesson article equipped with examples, a
													post-lesson quiz, and a daily practice session (which is random and
													goes on forever)!

												<h4>Coding Transformations & Graphing</h4>

												<!--project popup description-->
												<p>
													For my Grade 7 transformations Coding project, I exceeded
													expectations by creating a HTML, CSS, and Javascript web application
													instead of a simple Scratch project. I implemented a canvas to plot
													the coordinates of the triangle and beat measurements. I recieved a
													100% mark for
													this project and also a 100% mark on my report card for Math (the
													subject
													coding is apart of).

												<!--project popup description-->
												<p>
													For Ignition Hacks 2024, I collaborated with Grace, Jessica, and
													Olivia in a team of 4 to create WRAB, an application built to
													enhance your outdoor physical activities. Wrab provides a built-in
													route generator given a start/end point, a path creator given a
													start point and distance desired, and a map with markers for users
													to note down the location of water fountains, washrooms, and other
													hotspots. The maps use TomTom API and the routes are generated with
													the help of
													Spherical Geometry.

													<h4>Landing Remarks</h4>
													
													<p>
														Hi! Welcome to my ✨Space✨! Here's an introduction and some instructions on how
														to use my site! As you probably already know, I have 6 tabs on my site which can
														be accessed by hovering over the menu button on the top right and then selecting
														the desired tab to navigate to. Below, I provide a short description for each
														tab:
														<br><br>
														1. The 'Home' tab is a landing page for visitors (with a purple boba space
														image).<br><br>
														2. 'About' consists of insights into my personality, passions, strengths,
														interests, and skills.<br><br>
														3. The next tab, 'Achievements,' showcases three timelines regarding my
														achievements, experiences (community service, participation in major events),
														and education, with in-depth exploration into each.<br><br>
														4. 'Portfolio' is exactly what you expect it to be; this tab is a collection of
														all my projects (mainly software-based, but there is one hardware
														project, and many more to come 😁).<br><br>
														5. Obviously, 'Blog' is this page!<br><br>
														6. The final tab of my Space is the 'Contact' page, where you can send a message
														to me! I'll respond as soon as possible (through email), however I will not
														reply to unprofessional messages/spam.

													<h4>I'm twelve and won Best Womans Hack at</h4>
													<h3>Ignition Hacks 2025</h3>
													
													<p>
														Hey! On Friday August 16 and Saturday August 17, I participated in Ignition
														Hacks v.6 with my sisters and won Best Woman's Hack!
														<br><br>Here's a timeline & blog of my experience:
														<br><br>
														<strong>| August 15 |</strong>
														<br>
														The first day of this hybrid hackathon took place online, with a
														Zoom opening ceremony and a few workshops about AI/ML and some of the sponsors.
														<br><br>
														From 3:30 (kickoff) to 6:30, I collaborated with Olivia to create the basic
														foundation of our website and decide on the aesthetic (fonts, colour palette,
														theme).
														<br><br>
														I took a break from 6:30-8:30 to attend my Math class 😏!
														<br><br>
														By 9:00 PM, we had completed the basic header, footer, and main page containers
														and were beginning to work on creating the 5 tabs, Dashboard, Explore, Whisk,
														Mix, and Publish. Around this time, we started on the Explore Page and built the
														containers and cooking/baking buttons.
														<br><br>
														After completing the Explore page and some final styling, we worked on Whisk by
														reading a lot of the GrokAPI documetnation, creating our API key, and
														programming the page to accept a prompt and send a POST request to Grok's API
														endpoint when the user pressed the submit button. Unfortunately we encountered a
														bunch of problems and spent a lot of time debugging...
														<br><br>
														By 11:00 PM, we were finished Whisk, but we realized we were drastically behind
														schedule‼ We orignally planned to finish majority of the website by the end of
														Friday, August 16, but we later decided to just complete most of the
														functionalities and the javascript code for our Whisk and Mix tabs.
														<br><br>
														We worked on Mix until 12:30. Unfortunately as we couldn't find a reliable video
														generator API service, we were forced to switch to a AI image generator (using
														Stability AI's Stable Diffusion). Again, as with the Grok API problems, we spent
														A LOT of time debugging our javascript program 😔. However, the biggest barrier
														we encountered was that Stability AI does NOT give out COMPLETELY free API keys.
														We were unable to make more than 10 API calls, so we had to make another API key
														using my account to finish testing Mix.
														<br><br>
														<strong>| August 16 |</strong><br>
														Onto the next day of Ignition hacks :)
														We woke up at ~7:30 and drove to the Ted Rogers Management Center, where the
														in-person event was held. After we arrived and picked up the swag, we
														participated in the Opening Ceremony and one of the Sponsors' Workshops (CPA
														Ontario).
														<br><br>
														From 11:30-12:30, we worked on polishing the Mix and Whisk pages and planning
														the remaining pages.
														<br><br>
														For lunch, Ignition Hacks provided pizza, and I ate it with Olivia and two of my
														other older siblings
														Jessica and Grace (7/10, the crust was burnt 😭).
														<br><br>
														From 1:30 - 3:00, we finished the Publish page, which allows the user to add
														their own recipes to the Explore tab. This
														process was mostly smooth and barrier-free! We also completed the Dashboard and
														added some information about WhiskIt and instructions on how to use our site.
														<br><br>
														At 3:00, we were FINALLY finished testing, building, and styling Whiskit and
														moved onto creating the Devpost project and completing our submission! The
														deadline was extended by 30 minutes to 4:00 while the judging period was moved
														to 4:45, so we continued submitting our project until 3:45 and proceeded to work
														on our slideshow+presentation for the remaining 45 minutes.
														<br><Br>
														We took a chips break at 4:30 then continued to prep for our presentation.
														<br><br>
														At 5:10, we presented in the judging room and thankfully didn't exceed the time
														limit of 3 minutes. The judges asked us one question and then we exited as it
														was the next group's turn. Overall, our presentation went pretty well (9/10) and
														I feel like the key takeaway was to be less nervous and more calm. However, we
														were able to talk about everything we wanted to say about our project, which was
														great!
														<br><br>
														After eating pasta provided by Ignition Hacks for dinner, we chilled with
														Jessica and Grace and checked out their project, Snout Snout.
														<br><br>
														During the closing ceremony, we listened to the finalists' pitches and then the
														organizers announced that WhiskIt won Best Womans Hack🥳!
														<br><br>
														<strong>| Reflection |</strong><br>
														Overall, particpating in Ignition Hacks was an enlightening learning experience
														that I truly enjoyed! Olivia and I didn't expect to win, least of all Best
														Woman's Hack (we were aiming for Best Beginner's Hack), but the outcome was a
														really nice surprise! I feel like the lesson here is to actually enjoy the
														process of participating in a hackathon instead of just aiming for whatever
														prize you want the ENTIRE time, as you often end up thinking, 'what will the
														judges'
														like?' instead of following your instincts and game plan.
														<br><br>
														<strong>| Closing Statements |</strong> <br>
														I would definitely recommend Ignition Hacks to beginners or even
														intermediate/advanced hackers who would like to experience a fun and local event
														(if you live in Toronto). Obviously the prize track isn't that large and the
														sponsors aren't that well known, so if you're looking for a hackathon with big
														prizes and higher quality experiences (eg. better food, merch, etc.), this
														probably isn't for you. But if you're just here for some fun and probably hoping
														to learn (and possibly win), Ignition Hacks is a truly amazing event to
														participate in!
